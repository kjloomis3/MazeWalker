# MazeWalker
This is an example program used in a Java programming course.  which can be used to highlight  the following topics:
* 2 dimensional arrays (of objects)
* The JavaX Swing graphics library (with button interaction)
* Inheritance and abstract data types
* Introduction to artificial intelligence

This is a program that will draw a graphic depiction of an avatar (mazewalker) attempting to find its way out of 
the maze. The size of the maze is determined by user input and the maze is created randomly and may have more
one exit. Each time the user click the "step" button, the walker will advance towards its goal. There are multiple
types of walkers. Each tries to solve the maze using different techniques.
